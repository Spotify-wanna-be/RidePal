# Generate Playlist project 💻
Dear colleagues and guests,

We are pleased to introduce our group project - SpotifyWannaBe Web Application. SpotifyWannaBe is an innovative application that allows users to generate playlists specifically tailored to the duration of their travels based on their preferred music genres.




# What is SpotifyWannaBe?


RidePal is a web application that empowers you to create personalized playlists for your journeys. The playlists consist of individual songs, each with an artist, title, album, duration, and ranking. An important feature is the ability to preview the songs with a special audio stream URL.



## Playlist Structure:


Playlists have a title, tags (music genres), and a list of songs with details for each song. The total duration of the playlist is the sum of the durations of all songs. The playlist's rank is the arithmetic mean of the ranks of all songs in it.


## Why is SpotifyWannaBe unique?

SpotifyWannaBe allows you to personalize your musical experience during travel. We provide you with a tool that combines your preferences with the duration of your journey.


## How will SpotifyWannaBe work?

Users choose their preferred music genres and the duration of their travel. SpotifyWannaBe generates a unique playlist personalized for them. Each song is carefully selected to be suitable for the given travel time.


## The Future of SpotifyWannaBe:


We plan to expand functionality with additional customization options. Integration of social elements, such as playlist sharing and recommendations from friends.\

Thank you for listening. SpotifyWannaBe - your musical adventure during every journey!
